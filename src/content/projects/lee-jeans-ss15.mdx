## Overview

By scanning a QR code, fans will be directed to a WeChat site where they can select and customise three layers of visuals to create a 3D video. The video can be viewed through a special do-it-yourself holograph box allowing fans to enjoy their clip in 3D along with a refreshing scent, creating a 4D experience.
